In binary search
while start < end:
    sth = mid+1
    sth_else = mid 
OR 
while start <= end:

Global variables can be defined under class solution without __init__(), change global variables with self.global_var (Ex. 99)

Greedy Problem (1024, 45, 1326):
First we need ensure that the array has been sorted by start time. Then say in each step, we have a range [left, right], which means we can only visit the elements within the range in this step. We keep checking the elements until we are at the rightmost postion in [left, right] to update "farthestMove" , which means the farthest we can reach in next step.
